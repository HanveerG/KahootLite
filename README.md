A lightweight, multiplayer quiz game inspired by Kahoot!  
Built using Java with a simple GUI and socket-based networking.

## What It Does

Players can:

- Join or create a game using a unique PIN
- Choose from preloaded quiz topics (like history, geography, math)
- Answer timed questions (5 seconds each)
- See a ranked scoreboard at the end!

Games are hosted locally on a server, and any number of players can join before the host starts the game.
